# Atlas Laravel

Atlas is designed for apps built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [Vue](https://vuejs.org), and [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com). It bundles a Laravel backend with a library of Vue components to help teams spin up dashboards quickly. Both sides can be used together or independently.

Atlas focuses on eliminating the repeated setup that comes with every new project. It delivers guidelines and battle-tested building blocks so you can ship web-based applications faster, whether you're working on a full-blown admin system or a small dashboard.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require tmarois/atlas-laravel
```

## About

Our Laravel package handles the backend foundation and Inertia bridge. It includes tooling for:

- **DataTables** – build server-driven options for dynamic tables.
- **Enums** – export PHP enums for type-safe usage in Vue.
- **Model Service** – base model service providing CRUD scaffolding.
