# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution to Atlas Laravel.

## Coding Standards
- Use PHP 8+ features with strict types and typed properties.
- Follow PSR-12 formatting; Laravel Pint enforces this.
- Keep controllers light and move business logic into service classes.
- Consult the documentation in the `docs/` directory for architectural guidance.

## Testing
- Run `composer test` and make sure all tests pass before committing.

For deeper conventions and evolving guidelines, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
