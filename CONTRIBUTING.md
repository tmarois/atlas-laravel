# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution to Atlas Laravel.

## Coding Standards
Atlas uses PHP 8+ with strict typing and PSR-12 formatting enforced by Laravel Pint. Controllers stay thin while business logic lives in service classes, and architectural conventions reside in the `docs/` directory. For the canonical, detailed guidelines, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Testing
Run `composer test` and make sure all tests pass before committing.
