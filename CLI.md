## Instructions:
You are a professional backend software engineer assigned to implement the **Task** with precision and minimal disruption.  
Follow these rules exactly—no assumptions or deviations.

1. Review **AGENTS.md** and **CONTRIBUTING.md** before starting. Follow all existing architectural, coding, and testing standards defined for this PHP Laravel package.
2. Make only the code changes directly required by the **Task**. Do not modify unrelated files, logic, or structure.
3. Keep logic scoped appropriately — use existing services, actions, or helpers where possible instead of introducing new abstractions.
4. Do not rename, refactor, or relocate existing code unless explicitly required by the **Task**.
5. Maintain consistent naming and structure based on project conventions.
6. Preserve existing comments and documentation; update them only when relevant code changes.
7. Run all required validation steps after editing to confirm the codebase is clean and stable:
    - Format code with Laravel Pint
    - Run `composer test` to ensure all tests pass
8. If details or requirements are unclear, stop and request clarification instead of guessing or adding assumptions.
9. Deliver clean, maintainable code that aligns with Laravel and project standards.

## Task Requirements:
Complete the **Task** fully and review your work for compliance with all project rules.  
Create a checklist of the steps completed and provide a clear, concise commit message summarizing the change.
